# PROGRESS_TRACKING.md - Decisions, progress, and next steps

## Current milestone
- Setting up .md files for AI Agent Assisted Coding

## Decisions log
| Date | Decision | Rationale | Impact |
|------|----------|-----------|--------|
| 2025-09-09 | Standardized PROGRESS_TRACKING.md usage + aligned docs | Keep project docs consistent and actionable | Clearer onboarding and next steps |

## Open questions
- Which OpenAI model to use by default (gpt-4o-mini recommended for cost)?

## Usage
- Update after each working session or when scope/decisions change.
- Keep entries concise and dated when practical.

## Next steps
- [x] Add OG_SCHOOL_PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md to Repo overview in AGENTS.md (no adding of instructions to use it, it is purely user notes)
- [x] Define and add usage instructions for PROGRESS_TRACKING.md to AGENTS.md
- [x] Iterate until satisfied: check if PROGRESS_TRACKING.md internally is well defined for the usage instructions of PROGRESS_TRACKING.md in AGENTS.md and adjust it, if needed. reevaluate usage instructions for PROGRESS_TRACKING.md within AGENTS.md, adjust if needed.
- [x] Check for any major inconsistancies regarding the Project description, scope, implementation steps and high level architecture by checking REQUIREMENTS.md, ARCHITECTURE.md and PLAN.md. Point them out and align them, if needed.
- [x] Fill ARCHITECTURE.md based on REQUIREMENTS.md
- [x] Fill PLAN.md Goals/Non-goals based on REQUIREMENTS.md
- [x] add basic description/template for failure tracking to FAILED-DEV-INSIGHTS.md
- [ ] Start Implementation: Implement PLAN Step 1
